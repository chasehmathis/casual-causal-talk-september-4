Notes:

How can you simulate from a specified causal model?

Can simulate X ~ P(X); propensity score Z ~ P(Z | X); 
then potential outcome Y ~ P(Y | X, Z).

it's hard to reason from here what the marginal causal distribution
p(Y_z) is the distribution of Y given treatment is z.

Even if you're interested in the conditional CATE, you still may want to marginalize
over things.

When you get to longitudinal outcomes its even more difficult to simulate from
these models (references)

Can you decompose p(Y, X, Z) into p*(Y_z), p(X, Z), and a dependence beteween
Z and Y (potentially conditional on X).

Yes with causl and survivl


# use ipw not outcome regression because its the potential outcome / intervention
# distribution we assume is linear. Don't assume | L, A0 Y is linear.
